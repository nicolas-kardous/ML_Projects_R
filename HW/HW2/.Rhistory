# Some ethical concerns raised by the analysis is that it is assumed that there is no negative side effect for people who don't have
# CHD but who take the medicine. In reality, there could be a negative side effect. Additionally, a threshold value of 16% would seem
# pretty low for someone to be deemed to require medication. Thus, one way this analysis could be changed in the future, is to increase
# the threshold value from 16%, to increase the chance for people who have CHD to receive medication.
